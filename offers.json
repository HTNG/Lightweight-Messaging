ß// an offer context object is posted to /offers

// offer context is posted and an offer collection is returned each with URL
// PUT offer context would allow for changes to the context
// "lite" approach gets /offers via basic GET request with query params (do not support Pii)

//TODO: design offers context :
* profile
* special rate codes / affiliations
** discount codes, corporate codes, event codes
* date range (required)
* roomType
* hotel (this is part of the URL)
